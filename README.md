## fajita

early-stage prototype csg library.

the approach here has been mostly copied from cgal's implementation. shapes
and solids are modeled as nef polygons and polyhedra.

lots still needs to be done. user documentation and a detailed guide are in
the works.

the hope is to integrate this with petrify in the future for a
high-performance csg library that is easy to build for all platforms,
including wasm
